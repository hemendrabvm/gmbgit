                              their banks. Here are a few off-the-beaten-path

                              Karnataka. The monsoon season transforms Coorg into
                              a breathtaking landscape of rolling hills, lush
                              coffee plantations, and cascading waterfalls. You
                              can go for a plantation tour, visit the Dubare
                              elephant sanctuary, or trek through the dense
                              forests.
